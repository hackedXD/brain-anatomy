		"description": "**STARTED**\n\nThe cerebral cortex is the outermost layer of the brain, and it is responsible for many of our higher-level functions, such as thinking, feeling, and perceiving. It is made up of gray matter, which is composed of densely packed neurons. The cerebral cortex is divided into four lobes: the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe. Each lobe is responsible for different functions.\n\n**ENDED**\n\nThe cerebral cortex is involved in a wide range of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder. These diseases can damage the cerebral cortex and lead to a variety of symptoms, such as memory loss, impaired judgment, social withdrawal, and language problems.\n\nHere are some of the most common diseases of the cerebral cortex:\n\n* Alzheimer's disease: This is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes memory loss, cognitive decline, and eventually death.\n* Frontotemporal dementia: This is a group of dementias that affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Symptoms can include personality changes, impaired judgment, and language problems.\n* Schizophrenia: This is a mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. Symptoms can include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking.\n* Autism spectrum disorder: This is a developmental disorder that affects communication and social interaction. Symptoms can vary widely, but they often include repetitive behaviors and restricted interests.\n\nThese are just a few of the many diseases that can affect the cerebral cortex. If you are experiencing any symptoms that you think may be related to a cerebral cortex disease, it is important to see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.",

Amblyopia can be treated if it is caught early, but if left untreated, it can lead to permanent vision loss.\n* **Visual field defects:** These are areas of the visual field that are missing or distorted. They can be caused by damage to V1 or other parts of the visual pathway.\n* **Glaucoma:** This is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, which can lead to vision loss.

The VPM can be affected by Bell's palsy, leading to problems with touch, pain, temperature, and other sensory information from the face.\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems with your touch, pain, temperature, or other sensory information from the face and head, it is important to see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Here are some additional details about the ventral posteromedial nucleus:**\n\n* The VPM is located in the thalamus, which is a group of nuclei deep in the brain.\n* The VPM is about 2 centimeters long and 1 centimeter wide.\n* The VPM receives sensory information from the trigeminal nerve, which is the main sensory nerve for the face and head.\n* The VPM relays this information to the somatosensory cortex, which is located in the parietal lobe of the brain.\n\nI hope this helps!
